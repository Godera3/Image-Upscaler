this program was originally created on macOS but i'll make sure that it works on any OS
  make sure that python is installed


MacOS: 
    open terminal 
      run this command:   cd path/to/your/directory
        then run this command:   python3 main.py
          if you have python2 use this command instead:   python main.py

  if you don't have python installed on your mac you can use this command:   brew install python


Windows:
    open cmd
      use this command to go wherever you installed main.py:   cd C:\path\to\your\directory
        run this command:   python main.py

Linux:
    use Ctrl + Alt + T to quickly open terminal
      run the command   cd /path/to/your/directory (replace the path with actual path of your main.py)
        for python3 run this command:   python3 main.py
        for python2 run this command:   python main.py

  if you don't have python on linux do the following:
    
    Ubuntu/Debian:
      1. sudo apt update
      2. sudo apt install python3

    Fedora:
      1. sudo dnf install python3

    CentOS/RHEL:
      1. sudo yum install python3
